Encapsulation

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is bundling data, like a class. Instead of writing 100 lines of code describing multiple cars you can make a class of a car and make private functions of common components in a car, like engine, wheels, etc.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is in the middle of Encapsulation and Inheretance. Prevents code repetition, Improves flexibility, Working in large teams.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is when a subclass takes some methods from the base class. creates new classes from already created classes.
